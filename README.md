* **Luxury Value:** Despite higher prices, Wishful's sentiment is driven by sensory results like **'Glow'** and **'Softness'**.
* **Budget Risk:** The Ordinary is a value leader but faces significant negative sentiment regarding **'Dryness'** and **'Irritation'**.
* **AI Reliability:** The sentiment engine achieved a **92.68% accuracy** in classifying customer feedback.
